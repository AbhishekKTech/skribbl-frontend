# Skribbl.io Clone - Real-Time Multiplayer Drawing Game

**Live Demo Video:**
https://youtu.be/dsrWwDutcLw?si=jVqoMPMQlV90A0oH

A full-stack, real-time multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by Skribbl.io. The project implements a strict turn-based game loop, real-time canvas synchronization, time-based scoring, and a custom Object-Oriented game engine.

# Architecture Overview

The application follows a decoupled full-stack architecture designed for low latency and scalable multiplayer gameplay.

## 1. Frontend (Next.js + HTML5 Canvas)

Responsible for:

* Room creation and management
* Game phases (Lobby, Word Selection, Drawing, Reveal, Game Over)
* Glassmorphism-based user interface

### Canvas Engine

* Uses native HTML5 `<canvas>`
* Captures drawing events in real time
* Sends stroke coordinates `(x0, y0, x1, y1)` and brush settings to the server instantly

### Undo System

* Stores Base64 image snapshots in `canvasHistory`
* Restores previous canvas state using `drawImage()`

---

## 2. Backend Engine (Node.js + Express)

Acts as the authoritative game server.

Responsibilities include:

* Room management
* Turn handling
* Timer management
* Score calculation
* State synchronization

---

## 3. Real-Time Communication (Socket.IO)

Provides bi-directional communication between clients and server.

Events include:

* `draw_data`
* `canvas_clear`
* `undo_canvas`
* Room updates
* Score updates
* Game state transitions

---

# Core Features

## Multiplayer Rooms

Hosts can configure:

* Players: 2–20
* Rounds: 2–10
* Draw Time: 15–240 seconds

## Turn-Based Gameplay

* Tracks completed drawers using `drawnPlayers`
* Drawer receives 3 random words
* 15-second word selection phase
* Drawing timer starts automatically

## Real-Time Drawing

Features:

* Smooth synchronized drawing
* Multiple brush colors
* Canvas clearing
* Undo functionality

## Dynamic Scoring System

Points are awarded based on how quickly a player guesses the word:

```javascript
Math.floor((timeLeft / totalTime) * 500) + 100
```

## Leaderboard & Winner Detection

* Players ranked by `totalPoints`
* Final leaderboard displayed after all rounds
* Winner announced automatically

---

# Object-Oriented Design

The backend is structured using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## SessionEngine

Singleton coordinator responsible for:

* Managing active game sessions
* Room lifecycle management

## GameSession

Handles:

* Core game loop
* Turn rotation
* Word selection
* Timers
* Scoring
* Event broadcasting

## Participant

Represents an individual player and stores:

* Connection ID
* Display Name
* Total Points
* Drawing Status
